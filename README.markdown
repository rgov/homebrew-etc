This repo contains miscellaneous Homebrew formulae that I have needed at one
time or another. Most of the formulae are not maintained, written to mxcl's
meticulous style requirements, etc.

Just run `brew tap rgov/etc`. Additional information about using
[brew tap](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap) is on the Homebrew
wiki.
